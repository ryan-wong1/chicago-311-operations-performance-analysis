# Chicago 311 Service Requests - Operational Performance Analysis (Jan - Sep 2024)

This project analyzes Chicago 311 service requests (Jan - Sep 2024) to evaluate operational performance, resolution efficiency, and geographic workload distribution.

## Key Questions
1. Are 311 requests being resolved at the same pace they are created?
2. Is resolution speed improving or degrading over time?
3. Which community areas generate the highest request volume?
4. Do high-volume areas also experience slower resolution times?

## Key Findings
1. Request volume and resolved cases move closely together month-to-month which shows the city is generally keeping up with incoming requests.
2. Average resolution time increased from January through May even though request volume remained fairly steady which indicates a temporary strain on capacity.
3. Near West Side and O’Hare generate a much higher number of requests than most other community areas.
4. Areas with the highest request volume do not have the longest resolution times by a large margin which indicates uneven workload distribution rather than widespread delays.
