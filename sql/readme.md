## SQL Data Cleaning

This SQL script prepares Chicago 311 Service Requests data for analysis.

What the script does:
- Converts date fields from text to proper date/time format
- Calculates how long requests took to be resolved
- Identifies which requests are still open
- Groups unresolved requests by how long they have been open
- Checks that key category fields are consistent for reporting

Run `data cleaning.sql` after importing the raw dataset.
